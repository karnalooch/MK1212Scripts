# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Extended the game's military force interface (`MILITARY_FORCE_SCRIPT_INTERFACE`) with `AppointCharacter(character, [options])` — assigns a character as the commanding general of the army, creating their bodyguard unit (supports `{ bodyguard_key = string }`) and returning the previous general to the faction court.
- Added `twdll.battle.EnableSmeHealthBars([enabled=true])` — updates health bars on unit cards and 3D banners in real time for 1-man units (SMEs, monsters, single heroes) based on remaining hit points.

### Fixed
- Fixed `twdll.tweakers.SetInt(name, val)` returning `true` when setting non-existent tweaker names, properly returning `false` on unresolved names matching `SetFloat` and `SetBool`.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-08-23

### Added
- Added `twdll.tweakers` module and `TWEAKER_SCRIPT_INTERFACE` object interface (`twdll.tweakers.<name>.value = val`, `twdll.tweakers.Find(name)`, `twdll.tweakers.GetList()`, `twdll.tweakers.Dump()`) — provides dynamic reflection, inspection, and modification of all 3,731 internal developer engine tweakers across campaign variables, battle combat, AI behaviors, and rendering with automatic state rollback on Lua teardown. Transparently routes mutations to the active campaign model for all 714 Campaign Variables (action points, marriage/child birth rates, cultural conversion, looting, attrition, autoresolve, and plagues) alongside direct KV database items and per-frame shader/physics tweakers. Supports direct table property assignment (`twdll.tweakers.<name>.value = val`), property inspection on tweaker objects (`.name`, `.category`, `.description`, `.file`, `.line`, `.value`), object method chaining (`:GetValue()`, `:SetValue(val)`), and bulk list iteration via `GetList()`.
- Extended the game's faction interface (`FACTION_SCRIPT_INTERFACE`) with `GetTechnologyStatus(technology_key)` and `SetTechnologyStatus(technology_key, status)` — reads and dynamically changes technology research statuses (`0` = researched, `1` = disabled, `2` = researching, `3` = available, `4` = unavailable, `5` = not present, `6` = locked by faction level), instantly recalculating faction effect lists in real time (custom non-researched statuses must be re-applied on `FirstTickAfterWorldCreated` after save/load due to vanilla tree solver re-evaluations).
- Extended the game's faction interface (`FACTION_SCRIPT_INTERFACE`) with `InstantlyResearchTechnology(technology_key, [report_to_ui=false])` — instantly completes research of a technology through the game's native research completion path, firing events, achievements and unit upgrades and completing parent prerequisites recursively (defaults `report_to_ui` to false to prevent engine crashes on technology modules without completion bundles).
- Added `twdll.world.SaveGame(filename)`, `twdll.world.LoadGame(filename)`, `twdll.world.ExitToMainMenu()`, and `twdll.world.ExitGame()` — provides full programmatic control over the campaign lifecycle, enabling saving the active game to disk, loading saved games, exiting campaign to the main menu, and cleanly exiting the game process to Windows.
- Added `twdll.core.GetBuildSha()` — returns the 40-character hexadecimal git commit SHA hash from which the active DLL binary was compiled.
- Extended the game's character interface (`CHARACTER_SCRIPT_INTERFACE`) with `GetFullName()`, `GetForename()`, `SetForename(name)`, `GetForenameKey()`, `SetForenameKey(key)`, `GetFamilyName()`, `SetFamilyName(name)`, `GetFamilyNameKey()`, `SetFamilyNameKey(key)`, `GetClanName()`, `SetClanName(name)`, `GetClanNameKey()`, `SetClanNameKey(key)`, `GetOtherName()`, `SetOtherName(name)`, `GetOtherNameKey()`, and `SetOtherNameKey(key)` — dynamically reads and modifies all 4 name slots (forename, clan name, family name, and other name/title) on any character, providing explicit dual-path support for direct in-memory custom UTF-8 text strings as well as multi-language database localisation keys (`names.loc`), persisted across turns and save/load.
- Extended the game's character interface (`CHARACTER_SCRIPT_INTERFACE`) with `IsImmortal()`, `SetImmortal(is_immortal)`, `GetResurrectionTurns()`, and `SetResurrectionTurns(turns)` — inspects and controls character immortality flags (wounding instead of permanent death) and resurrection countdown turns.
- Extended the game's faction interface (`FACTION_SCRIPT_INTERFACE`) with `CreateAgent(agent_key, [settlement_or_x], [y])` — instantly creates and spawns a new agent character (e.g. `"spy"`, `"champion"`, `"dignitary"`, `"priest"`) on the campaign map adjacent to a settlement (defaults to faction capital) or at specific map coordinates (x, y) in the current tick.
- Extended the game's character interface (`CHARACTER_SCRIPT_INTERFACE`) with `TransferToFaction(target_faction, [options])` — instantly transfers the character and their commanded military force to another faction in the current tick. Supports an optional table `{ replenish_units = bool, rebel_region = region }`, with native engine cleanup of governorships/commerce raids/political plots, instant unit replenishment, regional rebel army creation, and proper event emission.
- Extended the game's character interface (`CHARACTER_SCRIPT_INTERFACE`) with `GetLoyalty()`, `GetLoyaltyModifier()`, `SetLoyaltyModifier(value)`, and `GetLoyaltyFactorList()` — dynamically reads total calculated character loyalty (0 to 10), inspects and adjusts the direct character loyalty modifier, and returns a detailed key-value table breakdown of all active loyalty factors resolved directly from the game's `loyalty_factors_tables` database.
- Extended the game's character interface (`CHARACTER_SCRIPT_INTERFACE`) with `AddTrait(trait_key, [show_message])`, `RemoveTrait(trait_key)`, and `GetTraitList()` — dynamically adds traits (via native command queue), removes traits and cleanly recalculates active stat bonuses and effect bundles, and returns a Lua array of all trait key strings currently present on the character.
- Added `twdll.world.GetMaxTraits()` and `twdll.world.SetMaxTraits(val)` — dynamically gets or sets the maximum character trait cap (vanilla hardcap of 10), enabling characters to acquire and display more traits across all trait acquisition systems.
- Extended the game's military force interface (`MILITARY_FORCE_SCRIPT_INTERFACE`) with `GetIntegrity()`, `SetIntegrity(value)`, and `HasIntegrity()` — dynamically gets, sets (with clamping between 0.0 and 100.0), or checks army integrity in real time.
- Extended the game's unit interface (`UNIT_SCRIPT_INTERFACE`) with `Disband()` — disbands (permanently removes) this unit from its military force using the engine's native disband path.
- Extended the game's military force interface (`MILITARY_FORCE_SCRIPT_INTERFACE`) with `DisbandUnits(...)` — disbands one or more units from the military force, accepting either `UNIT_SCRIPT_INTERFACE` objects or integer unit indices (0-indexed) as varargs.
- Extended the game's character interface (`CHARACTER_SCRIPT_INTERFACE`) with `SetArtSet(art_set_key)` — dynamically changes the character's visual master bundle (Campaign VMD, Battle VMD, Politician VMD, and 2D portraits) in real time, persisted across turns and save/load.
- Extended the game's character interface (`CHARACTER_SCRIPT_INTERFACE`) with `GetArtSet()` returning an `ARTSET_SCRIPT_INTERFACE` userdata for character art sets and portrait data (`GetKey`, `GetCulture`, `GetSubculture`, `GetFaction`, `GetAgent`, `GetGroup`, `IsCustom`, `IsMale`, `HasAging`, `HasSeasonal`, `HasLevelling`, `HasHealth`, `HasReligion`, `IsFactionLeaderSet`, `GetPortraitPath`, `GetSettingsId`).
- Added `twdll.cai.EnableLogging([enabled])` — enables or disables real-time Campaign AI decision logging and telemetry to `twdll.log`, capturing settlement occupation choices (`OCCUPY`, `SACK`, `RAZE`, `LOOT`, etc.) and decision bitmasks.
- Added `REGION_SCRIPT_INTERFACE:GetReligionList()` returning a `RELIGION_LIST_SCRIPT_INTERFACE` list of all religions present in the region, and `REGION_SCRIPT_INTERFACE:GetReligionProportion(religion_key)` returning the raw float proportion (0.0 to 1.0) of a specific religion. Added `RELIGION_SCRIPT_INTERFACE` (`GetKey`, `GetProportion`, `GetIconPath`) representing individual religion entries.
- Added `twdll.campaign_ui.SetEncyclopediaUrl(url)` and `twdll.campaign_ui.GetEncyclopediaUrl()` — dynamically gets or sets the base URL prefix for the in-game encyclopedia (e.g. redirecting in-game encyclopedia buttons to a custom local or web server), with automatic restoration of the game's default URL when passed `nil` or an empty string.
- Extended the game's settlement slot interface (`SLOT_SCRIPT_INTERFACE`) with `GetBuildingRotation()`, `SetBuildingRotation(rotation)`, and `Refresh()` — reads or sets the campaign-map building model rotation (`0..5`, representing 60-degree increments), persisted natively across save/load. Visual changes can be applied via `twdll.campaign_ui.RefreshSettlements()` or `slot:Refresh()`.
- Added `twdll.campaign_ui.RefreshSettlements()` to force an immediate campaign-map visual refresh of all settlement building models without reloading.
- Extended the game's character interface (`CHARACTER_SCRIPT_INTERFACE`) with `GetInfluence()` and `SetInfluence(value)` — dynamically reads or modifies the character's political influence.
- Extended the game's character interface (`CHARACTER_SCRIPT_INTERFACE`) with `SetDefaultBodyGuard(unit_key)` — sets a persistent default bodyguard unit for a general, saved natively with savegames and enforced at all recruitment and replacement choke points.
- Extended the game's character interface (`CHARACTER_SCRIPT_INTERFACE`) with `GetPoliticalParty()` and `SetPoliticalParty(party)` — gets or sets the character's political party allegiance, accepting either a `CAMPAIGN_POLITICAL_PARTY` object or a party record key string.
- Extended the game's faction interface (`FACTION_SCRIPT_INTERFACE`) with `GetPoliticalPartyList()`, `GetPoliticalParty(party_key)`, `GetPrimaryParty()` and `HasPoliticalParties()` for campaign politics, plus a new `CAMPAIGN_POLITICAL_PARTY` script interface (`GetKey`, `GetSenators`, `GetPower`, `IsPrimary`, `SetPrimary`) for the party objects they return. `GetPoliticalPartyList()` returns a native-style party list (`POLITICAL_PARTY_LIST_SCRIPT_INTERFACE`) iterated with `num_items()`, `item_at(index)`, and `is_empty()`.
- Extended the game's region interface (`REGION_SCRIPT_INTERFACE`) with `GetPopulationSurplus()`, `SetPopulationSurplus(value)`, `GetGrowthPoints()`, and `SetGrowthPoints(value)` — dynamically reads or modifies the population surplus (points to expand settlement slots) and growth points of a region.
- Extended the game's faction interface (`FACTION_SCRIPT_INTERFACE`) with `SetCapital(region)` — makes the given region the faction's capital.
- Extended the game's unit interface (`UNIT_SCRIPT_INTERFACE`) with `ConvertUnit(unit_key)` — replaces the unit with a new unit of the given type in the same army, using the engine's native unit conversion path (same as religion/technology upgrades). Health proportion (scaled men count), experience, and combat statistics are preserved, and general bodyguard snapshots are automatically synchronised. The original unit object is destroyed.

### Changed
- `twdll.world.SetMaxTraits([val])`, `twdll.world.SetMaxUnitsInArmy([val])`, `twdll.world.SetMaxUnitsInNavy([val])`, and `twdll.world.SetReinforcementCap([val])` now accept no arguments or `nil` to restore the game's vanilla defaults, and all modified world/engine limits are automatically rolled back to their original vanilla values when the Lua environment is detached/cleaned up.
- `twdll.core.Log` now accepts any number of arguments of any Lua data type (e.g. `nil`, numbers, booleans, tables, userdata), automatically converting them via Lua's `tostring` similar to standard `print(...)`.
- `GetInfluence` / `SetInfluence` replace the legacy Rome 2 character methods (`GetGravitas` / `SetGravitas` and `GetAmbition` / `SetAmbition`).

### Fixed
- Fixed an issue where multiple `package.loadlib` calls across scripts within the same campaign session created duplicate garbage collection proxies, causing premature uninstallation of campaign hooks during gameplay.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-08-06

### Added
- New `twdll.campaign_ui` functions: `SetMaxSlotsMajor` / `SetMaxSlotsMinor` and `GetMaxSlotsMajor` / `GetMaxSlotsMinor` - set/get the building-slot override separately for major (province capital) and minor settlements. The override now distinguishes the two via the settlement's capital flag instead of applying to every settlement.

### Changed
- `ClearMaxSlots` clears both the major and minor overrides.
- Docs build fixed: `custom.css` removed entirely, its rule (`max-width: 75em`) merged into the vendored LDoc stylesheet.
- `AGENTS.md` and `README.md` updated.

### Removed
- `SetMaxSlots` / `GetMaxSlots` removed (0.x, no backward compatibility) - use the `Major` variants instead.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-08-05

### Added
- New `twdll.campaign_ui` functions: `SetMaxSlots`, `GetMaxSlots`, `ClearMaxSlots` — override the maximum number of building slots shown in the settlement panel (`0` restores the game default).
- New `CampaignSettlementCallback::Initialize` hook, installed and uninstalled together with the other campaign hooks; the slot override is re-applied on every settlement panel open/refresh.

### Changed
- `AGENTS.md` and `README.md` updated.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-08-03

### Added
- **Live campaign/battle hooks**: ctor/dtor hooks for the `WORLD`, `CAMPAIGN_UI`, `CAMPAIGN_MODEL` and `BATTLE` (`EMPIREBATTLE::MANAGER`) singletons, installed on first load and uninstalled automatically when the Lua state is collected.
- New `twdll.world` module: `GetFactionCount`, `GetMaxUnitsInArmy` / `SetMaxUnitsInArmy`, `GetMaxUnitsInNavy` / `SetMaxUnitsInNavy`, `GetReinforcementCap` / `SetReinforcementCap` (pass `-1` to restore the game default).
- New `twdll.model` module: `DisbandUnits` — save/load-safe unit removal using the game's own disband path.
- New `twdll.battle` module: `GetBattleInfo` — live battle object, reinforcements manager, cap and queue size.
- New `twdll.campaign_ui` module: `GetMemoryAddress`.
- Extended the game's unit interface (`UNIT_SCRIPT_INTERFACE`) with `GetNumMen` / `SetNumMen`, `GetMaxNumMen` / `SetMaxNumMen`, `GetActionPoints` / `SetActionPoints`.
- Extended the game's faction interface (`FACTION_SCRIPT_INTERFACE`) with `GetTreasury` / `SetTreasury` and `SetFactionLeader` (supports the succession and heir-comes-of-age event variants).
- New Lua runtime signatures: `lua_getfield`, `lua_type`, `lua_settop`.
- Reworked test suite (9 cases: singletons, unit/faction interfaces, `SetFactionLeader`, treasury, `DisbandUnits`, army/navy caps, reinforcement cap, `GetBattleInfo`).

### Changed
- **API restructure**: all modules now live under a single `twdll` table — `twdll.core`, `twdll.unit`, `twdll.faction`, `twdll.military_force`, `twdll.model`, `twdll.world`, `twdll.battle`, `twdll.campaign_ui`. Old flat entry points moved accordingly (`twdll.Log` → `twdll.core.Log`, `twdll.set_max_units_in_army` → `twdll.world.SetMaxUnitsInArmy`).
- Property accessors rewritten from macros to template `Property` / `Getter` / `GlobalGetter` classes, with offset-based getters for embedded fields.
- Hooks install once per Lua state instead of on every DLL load.
- Build/tooling: MSVC toolset bumped to 14.51, GH Actions submodule init fixes, new CodeQL workflow, `tools/twdll.ps1` sets CPU affinity on Win11, docs build fixes.

### Removed
- The `twdll_character` and `twdll_battle_unit` modules are no longer registered in the new single-table layout.
